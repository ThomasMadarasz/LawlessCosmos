# Lawless Cosmos

This repository contains a copy of the features for Lawless Cosmos, a game in development by Orbit Owl Games using Godot and GdScript.

The sole purpose of this repository is to showcase my work for hiring purposes. You are allowed to browse the code, but not to modify or use it.

Lawless Cosmos is a Tactical Roguelite Card Battler where your characters form poker hands to perform moves. Defeat the waves to obtain powerful artifacts and valuable hand manipulations that will allow you to cheat.
